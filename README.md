🚀 Smart Quick-Commerce Operations Analytics Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

Quick-commerce platforms promise ultra-fast delivery but often create extreme time pressure on delivery riders, poor inventory planning, delayed orders, and high product wastage.

This project proves that faster delivery does not require rider stress — it requires smarter inventory control, data-driven planning, and operational visibility.

The dashboards analyze:

Delivery performance & delay risk

Inventory availability & wastage impact

Rider efficiency & workload balance

Customer satisfaction trends


Goal: Make 10-minute delivery safer, smarter, and more profitable.
